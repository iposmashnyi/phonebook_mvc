# Phonebook Project - Implementing MVC Pattern

This repository showcases my learning path by developing a simple Phonebook application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It is an early-stage project meant to demonstrate the application of MVC principles in organizing code and structuring a basic application.

## Features
- Add new contacts with name and phone number
- View contacts
- Update or delete contacts

## Future Improvements
- Add a search functionality
- Implement user authentication
- Add a graphical user interface
